# File Converter CLI 
By Edwin Pavlovsky

## The What
A simple and elegant python command-line-interface (CLI) for converting file types.

__Features__ (`--help`)
1. Convert file to any supported type under and path name (`--convert`)
2. See all file types the program supports (`--list`)
3. Check if the program supports a specific file type (`--supported`)

### The Why
  - While there are online services that offer file converting, they are often sketchy websites and are unclear about how they use the data you give them

  - By using this local CLI, you can convert files right on your own computer without having to worry about data privacy issues or getting viruses on your computer

### The How
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install python3 (if not already installed)
   - [Installation instructions can be found here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Follow instructions on `setup.txt`
    - This creates a python virtual environment that downloads all of the necessary python packages (which are needed to run this program) 
    - For a list of all packages, check out `requirements.txt`
4. Run the program by running: `python3 file-converter.py --help`
    - The `--help` flag shows you all of the supported commands and their required arguments
